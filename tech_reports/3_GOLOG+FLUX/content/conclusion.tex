Judging mainly from the papers by Levesque et~al.~\cite{levesque_golog:_1997} and Thielscher~\cite{thielscher_flux:_2005} it can be said that GOLOG does not satisfy the demands that arise from scenarios with multiple agents exploring unknown worlds. FLUX on the other hand is applicable to such scenarios as has been shown by Schiffel and Thielscher~\cite{schiffel_multi-agent_2007}. There, the authors succesfully applied FLUX to the gold mining domain.
