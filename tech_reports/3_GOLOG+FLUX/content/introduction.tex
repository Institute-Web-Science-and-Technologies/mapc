An important part of artificial intelligence research deals with autonomous agents acting in environments which are not or only partially known to the agents in the beginning. Allowing agents to reason about their knowledge and interacting with the environment is tackled by different programming methods. This technical report introduces the two logic programming languages GOLOG and FLUX. The basic structure of each language will be shown together with examples to ease understanding. In the first section the situation calculus will be presented. It is a logic formalism GOLOG builds upon. The two subsequent sections~\ref{golog} and \ref{flux} cover GOLOG and FLUX respectively. This report closes with a conclusion drawn from the features of GOLOG and FLUX regarding a multi-agent scenario with incomplete knowledge.
