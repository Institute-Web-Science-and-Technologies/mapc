Formal methods provide a logic abstraction for multiagent systems. They help to find self-consistent models of agent's behavior. However relatively high
complexity do not allow these methods to be implemented in real time systems. Therefore the role of formal methods nowadays is limited to debug, validate and design purposes. 

Also some implementation details were discussed that might be useful for our project. Among them is the concept of complex plans and plan libraries for agent internal implementation. For multiagent systems concept of agent skeletons for coordination may also be used in designing agents' actions.
