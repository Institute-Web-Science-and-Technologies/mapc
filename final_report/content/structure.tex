\todo{Carefully reread and update our previous/next sections to find out if we need this at all. Maybe we can just cut it out so we don't have to stretch few information into complete subsections which could be covered in later sections alongside their original topics.}
\subsection{Agents}
Talk a bit about generalisation e.g. a saboteur is a specialisation of an agent. I.e. both share exploring but the saboteur also knows how and when to attack. Explain what tasks our agents have and where our priorities are.
\subsection{Simulation Phases}
Explain the general split up into an exploration and a zoning phase. Also mention the parallel aggressive strategy of the saboteurs. Talk about repairers, explorers and inspectors and their special tasks but without going into details abouttheir complete strategy (this is part of the next chapter).
