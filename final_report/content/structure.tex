\subsection{Agents}
Talk a bit about generalisation e.g. a saboteur is a specialisation of an agent. I.e. both share exploring but the saboteur also knows how and when to attack. Explain what tasks our agents have and where our priorities are.
\subsection{Simulation Phases}
Explain the general split up into an exploration and a zoning phase.
