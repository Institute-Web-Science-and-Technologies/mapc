\subsection[Repairing]{Repairing$^{\diamond,\dagger}$}\label{alg:repairing}
As was already mentioned in the scenario description, any agent can become disabled after being attacked by an enemy Saboteur agent.
To become disabled in the scenario means to lose all of the agent's health points.
Naturally, we have implemented several supporting strategies for avoiding enemy Saboteur agents when possible and parry when there is a Saboteur agent nearby.
However, following these strategies does not guarantee that the agent will never become disabled, mostly because an \enquote{escape route} that would put an agent out of the attack range of an enemy Saboteur agent does not always exist and not all agents are able to perform the \texttt{parry} action.
When an agent becomes disabled, it loses most of its functionality: only the \texttt{skip}, \texttt{recharge} and \texttt{goto} actions can be performed.
Repairer agents can also perform the \texttt{repair} action when disabled, although repairing costs more energy to perform when disabled.
Disabled agents also do not count towards establishing team ownership of a map vertex, and thus do not contribute to zone scoring.

In~\autoref{alg:agentstrategies} it was said that the primary task of Repairer agents is to repair others, and that they should prioritize the \texttt{repair} action whenever they see a disabled friendly agent within their visibility range.
It is important that disabled agents are repaired quickly, and for this to happen the disabled agent needs to be brought within repairing distance of a Repairer agent.
In our implementation, every time an agent becomes disabled, it receives the high priority goal \emph{getRepaired}.
Following the plan of this goal, an agent requests an available Repairer agent and its position from the \emph{MapAgent}.
If the returned Repairer agent position is the same the disabled agent's position, then the disabled agent only recharges and waits to get repaired.
Otherwise, the disabled agent simply moves towards the returned Repairer agent position.
If there is no Repairer agent available within the part of the map that the disabled agent knows how to reach, i.e.\ the explored subgraph the disabled agent is currently on, the disabled agent will instead attempt to expand the knowledge of the map by moving towards the closest unexplored vertex.

Assignment of agents to their Repairer agents is done inside our Java MapAgent.
To be more flexible, we decided to perform these assignments on every step.
This allows the system to adapt to constantly changing situations, such as when agents are moving, some other agent becomes disabled or a previously disabled agents is repaired, freeing up a previously agent Repairer agent.
The assignment itself is done based on the hop distances between agents.
First, all the distances between all disabled agents and all Repairer agents are calculated.
Then, the paths with the shortest distance are selected and the agents belonging to these paths are assigned to each other.
If all Repairer agents are assigned and there are still some unassigned disabled agents, they get assigned to the closest Repairer agent, even though that Repairer agent is already assigned to another disabled agent.
his assigning approach in most of the cases led to fast and effective repairing.

In addition to disabled agents moving towards their assigned Repairer agents, Repairer agents can also move towards their assigned disabled agents.
This behaviour is only possible during the exploration phase of the simulation, because in zoning mode Repairer agents moving will often to lead to the zone they help maintain being broken up, which we would like to avoid.
We implemented this by making Repairer agents explore the map in the direction of their assigned disabled agents, i.e.\ if the vertex the Repairer currently occupies on the way towards its assigned disabled agent is not surveyed, they survey it, otherwise they will continue on their path towards their assigned disabled agent.

What happens if a Repairer agent becomes disabled?
We decided to not treat this as a special case, but instead use the standard procedure of disabled agent to Repairer agent assignment.
For this to work, for Repairer agents the goal of repairing a disabled agent is higher on their priority list than waiting to get repaired themselves.
This helps to use all the repairers more effective and prevents the situation when all the Repairer agents are disabled and waiting to get repaired.

\subsection[Zone Forming]{Zone Forming$^\circ$}\label{alg:zoning}
% TODO: sometimes, agents ``must'', ``will'', ``have to'' and other times they simple (actively) ``do'' things.
Zone forming is the most important part in the \mars{}~\cite{ahlbrecht_mapc_2014}.% p.3
It describes the process of agents finding and occupying vertices in a way that they enclose a subgraph.
We called this process zoning.
For our approach, zoning takes place after the map exploration phase.
This should ensure that enough information about the graph has been gathered to calculate high valuable zones close to the agents' current positions.
The algorithm for calculating zones and determining which agents have to occupy which vertices is presented in \autoref{alg:zon_calculation}.
Said algorithm is used in the process of finding and negotiating a zone to build, which is described in \autoref{alg:zon_finding}.
After a zone that can be built has been found, agents are assigned dedicated roles.
These roles determine the agents' duties and tasks throughout the lifecycle of a zone which they are part of.
The lifecycle of a zone includes its creation, defence and destruction.
Both roles and the lifecycle are featured in the last \autoref{alg:zon_roles}.
