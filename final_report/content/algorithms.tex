\subsection{General Strategy Overview}
This could also be an introductionary text which motivates the following subsections.
\subsection{DSDV}
What is it? How is it used in our context? What are advantages we gain from it? What is problematic (speed loss)?
\subsection{Exploration}
How do agents move around during the exploration phase?
\subsection{Zone Calculation}
This can also be dealt with in DSDV already but then with subsections.
\subsection{Zone Forming}
\subsection{Zone Extensions and Breakups}
