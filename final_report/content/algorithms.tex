\subsection{General Strategy Overview}
This could also be an introductionary text which motivates the following subsections.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Agent Specific Strategies}
How are the agents specialised? Explorers keep probing for long. Inspectors probe enemies so that we can avoid saboteurs. Saboteurs are attacking and can be called for zone defence. Disabled agents communicate with repairers and approach them. Depending on how short this or the ``General Strategy Overview'' section is going to be, they could be merged.

\subsection{DSDV}
What is it? How is it used in our context? What are advantages we gain from it? What is problematic (speed loss)?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Exploration}
How do agents move around during the exploration phase?

\subsection{Zone Forming}
% TODO: update this according to how the subsection will be in the end

Zoning is the most important part in the MAPC Mars scenario~\cite{ahlbrecht_mapc_2014}.% p.3
It describes the process of agents occupying nodes in a way that they enclose a subgraph. In subsection~\ref{alg:zon_roles} we introduce two additional agent roles which are assigned during zoning. Said roles define the tasks and duties of an agent in this phase.

For our approach, zoning should take place after the map exploration phase. This should ensure that enough information about the map has been gathered to calculate high valuable zones close to the agents' current positions. The algorithm for finding these zones and determining which agents have to occupy which nodes is presented in subsection~\ref{alg:zon_construction}.

The process of forming a zone and the associated agent communication is presented in the last subsection~\ref{alg:zon_formation}. It features the assignment of zone roles to agents. Furthermore, it is illustrated what zone is to be built and what the agents have to do to achieve this.

\subsubsection{Zone Negotiation}\label{alg:zon_formation}
Zoning happens asynchronously. Who registers when for zoning? How do they unregister?
How do agents decide what zone to form? Which agents become coaches and which become minions? How do agents know which node they have to occupy?
