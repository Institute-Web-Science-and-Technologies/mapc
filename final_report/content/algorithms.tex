\subsection{General Strategy Overview}
This could also be an introductionary text which motivates the following subsections.

\subsection{Agent Specific Strategies}
How are the agents specialised? Explorers keep probing for long. Inspectors probe enemies so that we can avoid saboteurs. Saboteurs are attacking and can be called for zone defence. Disabled agents communicate with repairers and approach them. Depending on how short this or the ``General Strategy Overview'' section is going to be, they could be merged.

\subsection{Zone Forming}

% TODO: explain what a ``zoning process'' is
Zoning is the most important part in the MAPC Mars scenario~\cite{ahlbrecht_mapc_2014}.% p.3
It describes the process of agents occupying nodes in a way that they enclose a subgraph. In subsection~\ref{alg:zon_roles} we introduce two additional agent roles which are assigned during zoning. Said roles define the tasks and duties of an agent in this phase.

For our approach, zoning should take place after the map exploration phase. This should ensure that enough information about the map has been gathered to calculate high valuable zones close to the agents' current positions. The algorithm for finding these zones and determining which agents have to occupy which nodes is presented in subsection~\ref{alg:zon_construction}.

The process of forming a zone and the associated agent communication is presented in the last subsection~\ref{alg:zon_formation}. It features the assignment of zone roles to agents. Furthermore, it is illustrated what zone is to be built and what the agents have to do to achieve this.

\subsubsection{Zone Negotiation}\label{alg:zon_formation}
% TODO: probably move it into a dedicated file
This section explains how agents decide on what zones should be built. It focusses on the communication between the agents. Agents start looking for zones when they have finished the exploration phase. As explained in section~\ref{alg:exploration}, explorer agents do not only survey but probe as well. Hence, other agents may finish the exploration phase earlier. Furthermore, zones can be broken up at any time allowing the agents to start looking for a new zone again. As a result, the zone finding process is in fact asynchronous. Problems arising from this are mainly dealt with throughout the actual building of zones which is illustrated in section~\ref{alg:zon_roles}.

In the beginning, all agents have to centrally register themselves when they are ready for zone building to indicate this availability. Next, each agent uses the algorithm presented in section~\ref{alg:zon_construction} to determine the best zone in his neighbourhood. The algorithm uses a range parameter $k$ which indicates the $k$-hop-neighbourhood up to which the algorithm will look for the best buildable zone. This range starts at $1$ and is incremented every time the agent finishes a zoning process without being part of a zone afterwards. As a result, it is likelier for an agent to find a buildable zone with a high per agent score. Thus, it is likelier for the agent to be part of a zone, because throughout every zoning process only the most valuable zone is going to be built. The range has a maximum to ensure that an agent will not look for zones too far away from it. When a zone is broken up, the range will be reset, which is covered by section~\ref{alg:zon_roles}.
