\subsection[Manuel Mittler]{Manuel Mittler$^{\odot}$}
This section lists the work done by Manuel Mittler .
He started in th project, together with Rahul and Sun, to get familiar with the Jason programming language and to implement initial actions like survey and probe. Afterwards simple plans were developed to execute the actions. Additionally he came up with the idea of following an aggressive strategy. After running into troubles when we started to communicate and negotiate between agents a lot, especially when it comes to zone building, Manuel proposed to switch to another approach. He suggested to let the JavaMap class decide/calculate which are the best zones and then assign the agents to these zones instead of letting the agents find the best zones by themselves with a lot of negotiation. Best in this regard means simply the best ratio of potential zone score over the number of agents which are necessary to build that zone. When he found out that disabled agents can still move, Manuel proposed to let the disabled agent move towards the repairer. This is beneficial in case the repairer agent is already involved in building a zone, because this zone would then not be destroyed. Later on he and Michael Ruster started working on zone forming, maintenance and destruction.
Manuel, together with Michael, also worked on the slides for our final presentation which was held by both together.
