\subsection{Collaboration Tools}
For collaboration on the code Github was chosen as a revisionsing system. The included Wiki was used for minutes of our weekly meetings, issue and problem tracking. Furthermore VoIP-solutions (Google hangouts and Skype) were used for collaborative programming and reconciliation. Not all problems were transformed into issues. Some were just mentioned and discussed in the Hangouts group chat and then quickly solved after.
