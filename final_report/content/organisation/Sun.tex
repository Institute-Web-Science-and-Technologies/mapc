This section lists the work done by Yuan Sun.
Yuan mainly focused on implementing actions of agents in this project. 

At the beginning, she started to learn how to use Jason programming language together with Manuel Mittler and Rahul Arora. In addition, she deleted a basic Java agent class called \texttt{"ActionHandler.java"} which is used to save some basic information of agents from the server in advance. At the same time, she did the modification on the interface between the MAPC server and our implementation, so it became available to execute actions without this basic Java agent class. However, this basic Java agent class,\texttt{"ActionHandler.java"}, was decided to be reused later after some discussions in the team.

At the primary stage, the codes about different actions executions were written in the same file. Yuan rewrote some of the codes in different files which are named by the roles of different agents. Yuan implemented initial actions like \texttt{probe}, \texttt{attack}, \texttt{repair} and \texttt{parry} with simple strategies when the other team members working on mapping and zoning. Therefore, other team members could check their codes work or not at that time. She also improved the codes for executing these actions, for example, adding the energy limitation to all agents and adding the visibility range limitation for those agents who should execute actions in a visible range. Moreover, with the project going on, Yuan continued implementing some more complex strategies on the agents after discussing them with other team members.

In the final technical report, Yuan wrote the sections related to Belief-Desire-Intention model. She did a presentation about Belief-Desire-Intention model before this project starting. In the report, she did not only introduce the theory of Belief-Desire-Intention model(see \autoref{fun:BDI}), but also did some statistics to analyze the use of Belief-Desire-Intention model in our project(see \autoref{imp:BDI_AS}).
