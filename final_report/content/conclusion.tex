\subsection{Competition results}
What place did we rank? How did the others do? Analyse our matches shortly and point out problems we faced, how we tackled them and point out what had gone well.
\subsection{Lessons Learned}
Here we could explain what was working well and what was troublesome. Java: fast. AS(L): slow and hard for us to program. Communication: extreme bottleneck. Also we could note that all this would need much more time and preparation (or a team that is more familiar with agent programming).
We can illustrate this with our approaches of a dedicated cartographer agent and the node agents. We might also illustrate further failed approaches.
