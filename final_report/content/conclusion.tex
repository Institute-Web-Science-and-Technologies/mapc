In this last part, we reflect on the actual competition as well as our own work.
First, \autoref{con:competition} presents the setup and procedure of the competition, as well as the results.
Moreover, some general observations we made while monitoring the behaviour of our agents throughout the matches are given in this section.
\autoref{con:learned} builds upon these observations by explaining in more detail the things we noticed and the conclusions we were able to draw from them.
This section also discusses more general lessons we have learned while developing our multi-agent system.
