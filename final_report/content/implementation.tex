\subsection{BDI in AS(L) and Jason}
Or in general: how did we implement what we had learnt from our scientific background?
\subsection{Information Flow}
Who gets what information how and when? How do we communicate with the server?
\subsection{Lifecycle of one Step}
Maybe illustrate what happens within one step and how we prevent multiple actions to be executed in one step.
\subsection{Competition results}
What place did we rank? How did the others do?
\subsection{Lessons Learned}
Here we could explain what was working well and what was troublesome. Java: fast. AS(L): slow and hard for us to program. Communication: extreme bottleneck. Also we could note that all this would need much more time and preparation (or a team that is more familiar with agent programming).
We can illustrate this with our approaches of a dedicated cartographer agent and the node agents. We might also illustrate further failed approaches.
