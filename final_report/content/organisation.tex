\subsection{Structure and Meetings}
Dynamic working groups that were built weekly to tackle the newly crafted tasks per week. In the beginning, we also tried some hacking sessions. But we quickly found out that working from home works best for us. Plans and discussions were held together in the weekly meetings (on the whiteboard).
\subsection{Git, Hangouts and Skype}
Revisionsing system, Wiki for minutes and issues for problems. VoIP-solutions for collaborative programming. Not all problems were transformed into issues. Some were just mentioned and discussed in the Hangouts group chat and then quickly solved after.
