\subsection[Simulation Phases]{Simulation Phases$^{\star,\circ}$}\label{arc:simulation}
This section illustrates our match strategy roughly from a high-level point of view.
Our general approach for the simulation was to split it up into two phases, namely an exploration phase and a zoning phase.
In the exploration phase, we tried to explore the map as quickly and complete as possible.
Throughout the zoning phase, agents would look for zones, form and defend them.
The exploration phase is explained in this section in more detail, while the zoning phase is covered in separate section due to its complexity.

Basically all agents were used for exploration, but we used for each role other priorities.
The highest priority was always to use the role defining ability if applicable.
For example if the Saboteur agent could attack any enemy agent, it attacked.
If a repairer agent could repair some damaged agent from our team, it repaired.
If the highest priority action was not applicable and the agents tried to explore the map (see \autoref{alg:exploration}).
Each agent decided which action to do autonomously based on the information it got from the map component or its percepts.
The component itself centrally stored all information about the map and is presented in \autoref{alg:map_javamap}.
We distinguished three group types of exploring agents.

The first group consisted only of Explorer agents.
Their highest priority was to get vertex values by probing.
Secondarily they used the \texttt{survey} action to explore the map only if they came across vertices which were not surveyed.
They were not actively searching for or going to not surveyed vertices.
Instead, they moved somewhat circular towards vertices which were not surveyed yet as further described in \autoref{alg:agentstrategies}.

The second group was comprised of Saboteur agents.
We followed a very aggressive strategy and aimed to attack and disturb the enemy as much as possible.
Consequently, we did not want to distract our Saboteur agents by exploring the map.
Saboteur agents would only explore the map if they did not know of an active enemy somewhere on the already explored map.
As part of our aggressive strategy, there was one Saboteur agent which would even then not start exploring.
Instead, it would try to increase its visibility radius to find more distant enemies.
This is explained in more detail in \autoref{alg:agentstrategies}.
The Saboteur agents stayed with this strategy throughout the whole simulation and not only the exploration phase.

The third and last group consisted of the remaining agents, which were the Repairer agents, the Sentinel agents and the Inspector agents.
These agents were used mainly for exploring the map.
They were coordinated by querying the map component for the next unexplored\todo{Explain what unexplored means. A nearby unvisited vertex?} map area.
If agents of the third group came to a vertex that had unknown edge weights to at least one neighbour vertex, they used the survey action to get the information as percepts.
These weights were then passed to the map component and they repeated the exploring, by querying for the next not surveyed vertex and going there.
To prevent multiple agents from going to the same vertex and exploring the same area, the map component used an internal locking mechanism.
We were not interested in a full coverage of the map\todo{is this true or did we explore 100\%?}.
This was due to a full map exploration would have consumed a lot more steps while bringing only little improvement to the knowledge about it as a whole.
So we decided to remove every agent from the exploring agent team which could not be assigned a not surveyed vertex
They were then enabled to start building zones.
By this we prevented agents from doing nothing and just idling around\todo{this goes hand in hand with the earlier todo. I am confused why they would idle if ``[w]e did not need a full coverage of the map''? So that means they could have done things because they would still have been ``assigned [to] a not surveyed vertex''}.

In the zoning phase all agents which were finished with their exploration phase, were used to build zones.
This included the Explorer agents but excluded the Saboteur agents, because they were following their own aggressive strategy.
A detailed description of the zoning phase is given in \autoref{alg:zoning}.
