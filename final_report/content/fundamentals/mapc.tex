% This is the text from the TOC:
% What is the general scenario? Agents on mars trying to find water in a competitive manner against another team. Explain the concept of zones, gaining points, achievements and also how agents differ from each other.
% I've put this section first so the later chapters can already rely on the reader knowing what the scenario is about. Furthermore, we can then directly rule out concepts which we are presenting by applying them theoretically onto the scenario/our needs.
