In multi-agent environment, where each agent has its own beliefs, desires and goals, achieving a common goal usually require some sort of cooperation. It most of the cases it can be achieved through communication and negotiation among groups of agents. Often negotiation is supported by some arguments which help to identify which agent is more suitable for completing certain task. Among them could be better position, better resources for completing the task, importance of current goal and so on. Some arguments can be also used to change the intentions of other agents. This could be the arguments like reserving the node to explore or the enemy to attack and many others. Argumentation is essential when agents don't have the full knowledge about other agents or environment. In such cases exchanging information helps to develop the consensus and make cooperative decisions.

To negotiate effectively a BDI agent requires the ability to represent and maintain the model of its own properties, such as beliefs, desires, intentions and goals, reason with other agents' properties and be able to influence other agent's properties \cite{Kraus_98}. These requirements should be supported by the agent programming language we choose to for our project.
