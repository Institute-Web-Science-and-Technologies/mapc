Multi-agent programming is an ongoing field of study.
Agents are embedded in scenarios which describe the environments and assign the agents specific tasks.
Some tasks can be fulfilled by agents working independently while others need them to work cooperatively.
There are also scenarios in which agents work competitively.

% some sentences that I'll probably reuse:
The \emph{Multi-Agent Programming Contest} is an annual online programming contest hosted by the Clausthal University of Technology since 2005.
Participation is free to any interested groups, and in former years rewards were given to winning teams in the form of book vouchers.
This year's MAPC, however, was an \enquote{informal} contest, and no prizes were awarded.
The aim of the MAPC is to promote academic interest in the field of multi-agent systems, that is, systems in which multiple artificial agents have to collaborate to achieve a goal.

The German University of Koblenz-Landau participated in the 2014 MAPC with a small team of graduate students in the scope of a research lab.
