\subsection[Agent Programming Languages]{Agent Programming Languages$^\circ$}
We investigated several agent programming languages, for their suitability for the \mars scenario.
Our goal was to determine which specialised language we wanted to use for multi-agent programming, if any.
The following sections present the basic structure of various languages together with examples.
These examples are unrelated to the \mars scenario and are kept simple for ease of understanding.
Using the Mars-scenario for examples instead would have meant to either make them complex or to trivialise them to a point where they become too superficial to suit the scenario.
\autoref{fun:apl_sitCalc} first introduces the situation calculus.
Although not an agent programming language, it serves as a foundation of the logic programming language GOLOG presented in \autoref{fun:apl_golog}.
It also helps in understanding the subsequent \autoref{fun:apl_flux} which summarises the main concepts of FLUX.
FLUX is another logic programming language which was partly motivated by the flaws of GOLOG.
\autoref{fun:apl_jadex} introduces a Java-based agent programming language.
After that, AgentSpeak(L) is presented in \autoref{fun:apl_asl} which is another logic programming language.
Jason is an interpreter for this language and is discussed in \autoref{fun:apl_jason}.
The section focuses mainly on the extensions that Jason adds to AgentSpeak(L).
The final \autoref{fun:apl_choice} considers the previously presented agent programming languages and explains our decision for choosing Jason.
