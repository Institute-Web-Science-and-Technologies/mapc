\subsection{Agent Programming Concepts}
% I'd actually prefer Subsubsections numbered, without the trailing dot
% and with real section padding. But that's part of the template, soâ€¦
\subsubsection{BDI.}
\subsubsection{Formal Methods.}
\subsubsection{Negotiation and Argumentation.}
\subsubsection{Agent Societies.}
\subsection{Agent Programming Languages}
\subsubsection{GOLOG and FLUX.}
\subsubsection{Jadex.}
\subsubsection{AgentSpeak (L) and Jason.}
Why are AS(L) and Jason so awesome that we chose them over the other options? Why didn't we invent our own language or at least our own system/architecture/infrastructure?
\subsection{MAPC: Contest and Scenario}
What is the general scenario? Agents on mars trying to find water in a competitive manner against another team. Explain the concept of zones, gaining points, achievements and also how agents differ from each other. Introduce the notion of \emph{zoning} as the process of finding, forming, defending and destroying a zone.
