\subsection{MAPC: Contest and Scenario}
\subsection{Agent Programming Concepts}
% I'd actually prefer Subsubsections numbered, without the trailing dot
% and with real section padding. But that's part of the template, soâ€¦
\subsubsection{BDI.}
\subsubsection{Formal Methods.}
\subsubsection{Negotiation and Argumentation.}
\subsubsection{Agent Societies.}
\subsection{Agent Programming Languages}
\subsubsection{GOLOG and FLUX.}
\subsubsection{Jadex.}
\subsubsection{AgentSpeak (L) and Jason.}
