\subsection{MAPC: Contest and Scenario}
\todo{Write this section}
What is the general scenario? Agents on mars trying to find water in a competitive manner against another team. Explain the concept of zones, gaining points, achievements and also how agents differ from each other. Introduce the notion of \emph{zoning} as the process of finding and forming a zone (including upkeeping by defense?).
I've put this section first so the later chapters can already rely on the reader knowing what the scenario is about. Furthermore, we can then directly rule out concepts which we are presenting by applying them theoretically onto the scenario/our needs.

\subsection[Agent Programming Languages]{Agent Programming Languages$^\circ$}
We investigated several agent programming languages, proposed by our supervisors, for their suitability for the \enquote{Agents on Mars} scenario.
Our goal was to determine which specialized language we wanted to use for multi-agent programming, if any.
The following sections present the basic structure of various languages together with examples.
These examples are unrelated to the \enquote{Agents on Mars} scenario and are kept simple for ease of understanding.
Using the Mars-scenario for examples instead would have meant to either make them complex or to trivialise them to a point where they become too superficial to suit the scenario.
\autoref{fun:apl_sitCalc} first introduces the situation calculus.
Although not an agent programming language, it serves as a foundation of the logic programming language GOLOG presented in \autoref{fun:apl_golog}.
It also helps in understanding the subsequent \autoref{fun:apl_flux} which summarises the main concepts of FLUX.
FLUX is another logic programming language which was partly motivated by the flaws of GOLOG.
\autoref{fun:apl_jadex} introduces a Java-based agent programming language. After that, AgentSpeak(L) is presented in \autoref{fun:apl_asl} which is another logic programming language.
Jason is an interpreter for this language and is discussed in \autoref{fun:apl_jason}.
The section focuses mainly on the extensions that Jason adds to AgentSpeak(L).
The final \autoref{fun:apl_choice} summarises the previous sections and explains our decision for choosing Jason.
